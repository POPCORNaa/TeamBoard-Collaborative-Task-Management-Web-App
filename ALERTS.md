# Alert Ideas

## Alert 1: High Error Rate
Trigger an alert if the HTTP error rate (5xx responses) exceeds 2% for more than 5 minutes in production. This helps detect service degradation early before it impacts many users.

## Alert 2: High Latency
Trigger an alert if p95 latency exceeds 500ms for more than 3 minutes. This indicates performance issues that may affect user experience and needs immediate investigation.
